# Federated Inference Using Self-Generated Policy
[Watch the video](https://ibm.box.com/v/Showcase-1c03-video)

## Military / Coalition Issue
When operation at the tactical edge or in any distributed environment, it may not always be possible to share data
across sites or edge nodes. One approach to address this limitation is to federate the results of the model
inference across site. In this demo, we will show a rule-based approach of federated inferencing, where the rules
are self-generated based on contextual conditions.

## Core idea and key achievements
* Inferencing across the tactical edge when data cannot be shared for variety of reasons, e.g., Security/Reliability
and Network Bandwidth.
* Peer to peer connectivity to edge nodes when connectivity to central site of cloud is limited.
* Dynamic policy generation of classification ensemble weights to alleviate the need for end user to manually author
and edit policies.
* Classification of events or data using ensemble approach across distributed edge nodes.

## Implications for Defence
The key achievements in the previous section have implications in military defense settings as well as civilian.
Classification of data, without connectivity to a shared or cloud server, may be challenging in an edge setting such
as a military base. In some cases, trained models may not be mature enough to accurately classify certain data.
Federated Inferencing can help in some cases by reaching out to nearby coalition bases to find more mature models to
improve the accuracy of machine based classification.

## Readiness & alternative Defence uses
Version 1 of the Edge AI SDK that incorporates all the described functionality is currently available within IBM
Research. Ready to prototype a military Edge AI production facility, and experiment with a range of potential usage.
Deployed in an experimental 5G Edge testbed at IBM Research.
