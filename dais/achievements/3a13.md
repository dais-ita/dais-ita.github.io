# AI based Analysis of Terrorism Events

## Military / Coalition Issue
Historical data about important events or activities from adversaries is often incomplete, containing partial or inconsistent information, or missing events entirely. The ability to train machine learning models depends on high-quality data for both training and testing, we investigated data with these issues related to terrorism events in India (2008- 2017).

## Core idea and key achievements
We used a combination of data augmentation, by fusing the terrorist event data with related demographic census data, and inference to predict missing values, and to determine the features that most strongly predict the perpetrator of each incident.

For prediction/inference we identified multiple ML models could be easily trained to infer the perpetrator, with up to 82% accuracy, thereby augmenting this missing information for 55% of the available data. We used explainable methods to determine feature sensitivity, identifying that spatial location (particularly longitude) was by far the strongest indicator of the group perpetrating the attacks.
Related work in the same space considered the use of generative models for predicting terrorist incidents, and a two-mode approach based on analysis of social network data, broadening the set of potential tools available to augment the human analysts in this space.


## Implications for Defence
By placing such analytic methods into the hands of intelligence analysts it is possible for them to augment available data sources, both through information fusion with other sources, and through inference of missing values.  By using explainable methods, we were able to provide insight into the features that most affect the predictions, informing the analyst and potentially enabling additional insight and reasoning for them.

## Readiness & alternative Defence uses
TRL 5/6. The underlying tools and techniques are all well known in the technical/research community, but the ability to quickly apply them to different data sources by less technical users, and extract insights into behaviour and performance could be a useful improvement.
