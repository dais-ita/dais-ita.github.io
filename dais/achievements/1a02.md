### Dynamic Communications Replanning Using a Vector Symbolic Architecture
[Watch the video](https://ibm.box.com/v/Showcase-1a02-video)

#### Military / Coalition Issue
The Military relevance of this task is in a future coalition context where analytics applications can
be automatically composed from sensors and services that may be distributed across the coalition network
and owned by different coalition partners.  This is sometimes referred to as the Internet of Battlefield
Things (IoBT).  How is it possible to discover the required component services and compose the necessary
workflows to perform distributed analytics tasks?  Is it possible in contested environments to be resilient
against network fragmentation and loss of computational assets?  

#### Core idea and key achievements
The core idea is that sensors, data and services (essentially anything) can be described as symbolic
semantic binary vectors. Essentially everything is described as a vector of vectors.  These vectors have
mathematical properties that can be exploited to provide a new way of performing service decentralized
peer-to-peer service discovery with no requirement for centralized control.  Our key achievement has been
to show how to create these vectors from service and sensor descriptions and how these vectors can be
bundled together to create new vectors that describe the service workflows that describe the required
analytics applications.

#### Implications for Defence
Using vector representations of sensors, data and services provides an important new way to rapidly
configure available assets to perform new tasks in highly dynamic military operations. In a coalition
setting the use of semantic vector representations offers the potential to discover and make use of assets
owned by other coalition partners to perform required tasks.   

#### Readiness & alternative Defence uses
We have already demonstrated that how the vector representation can be used to perform tasks such as
dynamic communications re-planning and to discover and orchestrate NATO FMN services. These demonstrations
have used representative simulations of MANET environments.  Higher TRL levels could be archived by
demonstrating the technology operating in actual wireless networks.
