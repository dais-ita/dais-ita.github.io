# Model Poisoning Attacks and Defences in Federated Learning
[Watch the video](https://ibm.box.com/v/Showcase-1e05-video)

## Military / Coalition Issue
Federated learning is being increasingly adopted for information sharing and distributed model training between
coalition members while simultaneously addressing their data sensitivity concerns. It allows the coalition members to
perform local model training at the edge and only share insights in the form of model parameters with a central server.
The server mediates a multi-round model training protocol, between the members, to assimilate all the local information
into one global model. This global model, shared between the agents, is then used for critical decision-making. It is
thus imperative to analyse and assess adversarial mechanisms that can be used to introduce vulnerabilities into the
global model, and ways to mitigate them.

## Core idea and key achievements
There are two key achievements. First, we proposed model-poisoning attack to introduce targeted backdoor into the
global model trained using federated learning. We demonstrated that it is possible for an adversary to manipulate the
model weights and introduce targeted misclassification by the global model while maintaining attack stealth. This is a
class of attacks different from the more traditional Byzantine attacks considered in prior works. We then evaluated the
efficacy of the attack in a p2p setting. Second, we proposed a provable defence that combines ideas of top-k
sparsification together with gradient clipping to bound the adversarial impact on the global model. We performed a
large-scale evaluation of both the attack (under colluding attackers) and defence effectiveness.

## Implications for Defence
Understanding the risks of deploying federated learning will allow the decision maker to remain vigilant of possible
attacks. Proposed defence mechanism together with secure aggregation techniques could introduce resilience and reduce
the risk of deployment.
