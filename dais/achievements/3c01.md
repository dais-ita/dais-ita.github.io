# Generative Modelling of Human Groups

[Watch the video](https://ibm.box.com/v/Showcase-3c01-video)

## Military / Coalition Issue
The way in which human groups form, sustain and evolve is an important factor in many adversarial scenarios where individuals can have a significant role in influencing the disposition and actions of others. This is wide ranging, from peace keeping scenarios, to extremists or even disruptive online activities as seen through mis-information campaigns. 

## Core idea and key achievements
The science has been developed to establish ways in which agents in computerised “agent-based models” can be embedded with psychological behaviours, resulting in the evolution of collective effects that define how group behaviour may emerge. This extends psychology to groups or crowds. It allows the cultural spread of particular behaviours to be examined. This is primarily focused on i) prejudice, ii) identity, and iii) cognitive dissonance. These are important because these are responsible for motivating behavioural responses in individuals.  

## Implications for Defence
The technology makes it possible to explore particular scenarios on how groups may evolve. This can aide training, planning, and wider understanding of how human psychology, at the individual level, can influence the groups that military operations may face, such as under stress or cultural distrust. 

## Readiness & alternative Defence uses
The research has established the concepts and capabilities at a fundamental, resulting in two Nature publications (Scientific Reports) and a further pending IEEE transactions publication. This represents low TRL research. However, there is substantial potential to translate this into online social networks (e.g., the detection of strength of identity fusion for online analysis of social media interactions) to address scenarios such as engagement with identity fusion.
