# Learning Features of Network Structures using Graphlets

[Watch the video](https://ibm.box.com/s/mjr3ms1157hkebceohvigqar8usn1yyy)

## Military / Coalition Issue
Network structures in dynamic contexts are rarely static, and often function with considerable complexity. These networks could represent diverse concepts such as communication, social network activity, online media or many other issues. To understand such networks, traditional graph theory has limitations because we may not have full sight of the full network. Therefore being able to make assessments through the presence of substructures is important. 

## Core idea and key achievements
This achievement summarises the progress made in using graphlets (small connected substructures) for analysis and exploitation of induced substructures for potentially complex network structures. This will focus on:

•	Applications to social media for the detection and assessment of mis-information, disruption and controversy;

•	Alternative ways to interpret paths through the way that they “cut through” graphlets;

•	Ways to exploit graphlets through network embedding to provide an alternative network representation that can be exploited through machine learning.  

## Implications for Defence
The military can use these techniques in setting where only potential network information is available – the presence of graphlets can be collected from dynamic, disconnected and temporal snapshots of networks and used for analysis through these techniques. 

## Readiness & alternative Defence uses
The research has been carried out at a fundamental level but has been applied in interesting real-world network scenarios, including those relating to mis-information, and COVID19. This means that the work can be readily made available for transition.
