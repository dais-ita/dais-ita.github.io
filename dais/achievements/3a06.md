## Military / Coalition Issue
Understanding the spread of opinions on a social network is a challenging problem. It is important to understand this spread in terms of the influencer, the influenced, and the temporal dimension. 

## Core idea and key achievements
Curse words and polarized opinions exhibit various spread patterns on social networks. This body of work models the spread of curse words assessing the propensity of an entity in a social network to express a negative opinion in the future. Using both statistical modelling approaches (Hawkes Point Process) and deep learning approaches (Graph LSTM), our evaluations on the Twitter dataset show that considering network effects improves prediction performance by over 30%, quantifying the effect of immediate neighbours on dissemination of opinions in the network.

We have tested our approach for modeling the spread of curse words on Twitter. The proposed approach is compared with an adaptation of Hawkes Point Process to graphs, wherein an entity in a social network may be excited (to utter a curse word) based on the total excitation potential of all the nodes in a k-hop radius around the said node. The proposed approach shows about 30% improvement over the baseline for capturing the positional (who) and temporal (when) dynamics of curse word spread on a social network. 

## Implications for Defence
The proposed method offers a method of studying the spread of opinions on a social network. It can be used for what-if analysis when polarizing opinions are injected into a social network through select entities.

## Readiness & alternative Defence uses
Provides a technique that can be immediately engineered and applied. However more experiments may be required to assess the suitability of the technique for a target social network.
