# Predicting Spread of Negative Attitudes and Behaviors in Social Networks
[Watch the video](https://ibm.box.com/v/Showcase-3a06-video)

## Military / Coalition Issue
Understanding user behavior on a social network is a challenging problem. It is important to understand how this
behavior changes in terms of the influencer, the influenced, and the temporal dimension.

## Core idea and key achievements
This work uses utterance of curse words as a proxy for user behaviour. Utterance of curse words typically exhibit
both temporal and spatial clusters, i.e., the propensity of a node in a social network uttering a curse work is
highly dependent on the nodeâ€™s neighbour uttering curse words in the recent past. This work introduces a new modelling
technique, based on Graph LSTMs (Long Short-term Memory), that improves predictability of who and when will utter
curse words next. Evaluations on the Twitter dataset show that considering network effects improves prediction
performance by over 30%, in comparison with traditional statistical models such as the Hawkes Point Process.

Unlike prior efforts, this new model fundamentally captures the behavior both along the graph and the time dimension.
Core to the construct is the graph convolution operator that convolves a signal (number of curse word utterances per
unit time) over a neighborhood in a graph. Combined with a LSTM layer the model captures how the signal spreads over
time on the graph structure. In addition, the new model supports what-if analysis in the form of predicting how
changes to the graph structure or how initial point of infusion (who uttered the curse word first) can influence its
overall spread on the social network.

We have tested our approach for modeling the spread of curse words on Twitter. This new approach is compared with an
adaptation of Hawkes Point Process to graphs, wherein an entity in a social network may be excited (to utter a curse
word) based on the total excitation potential of all the nodes in a k-hop radius around the said node. The proposed
approach shows over 30% improvement over the baseline for capturing the positional (who) and temporal (when) dynamics
of curse word spread on a social network. 

## Implications for Defence
This new method offers a method of studying the spread of opinions on a social network. It can be used for what-if
analysis when polarizing opinions are injected into a social network through select entities.

## Readiness & alternative Defence uses
This work is technology readiness level (TRL) 3-4. It provides a technique that can be immediately engineered and
applied. However, more experiments may be required for assess the suitability of the technique for a target social
network.
