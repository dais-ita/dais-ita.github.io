# New Device Detection and Description in an Internet or Device Network

## Military / Coalition Issue
Cybersecurity/Internet of Things/Network Traffic Analytics. Detect and describe previously unseen devices in a network by analysing network traffic data.

## Core idea and key achievements
A traditional AI model is trained to recognize devices based on network traffic data. When a new device is introduced to the network, the traditional AI model cannot recognize it/characterize it, because it has never seen it before. The proposed research can recognize, or at the very least, describe a new device in the network using a set of attributes, which are learned during training and are shared across all IoT devices. 

## Implications for Defence
This technology allows an agent to identify or at the very least describe a new device on a monitored network, even though it has never been seen before.

## Readiness & alternative Defence uses
At this stage, the technology has been tested and proven to work with promising results as a demo on a single dataset of network traffic data among IoT devices. More experiments are underway involving multiple datasets.  The component needs a network traffic data sniffer and feature extractor to provide network traffic data in the proper input format. It can potentially be integrated in the Biloxi framework. It relies on modern deep learning libraries for the AI model definition and training.
