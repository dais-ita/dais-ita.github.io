# UK DAIS Showcase Event

## Objective:

To inform UK military stakeholders and relevant Dstl Programme staff of the DAIS ITA scientific achievements addressing coalition analytics, networks and information challenges so (a) understand future potential (e.g. impact on capability) & (b) support/sponsor transition activities.

## Demonstration Stands 

Stands cover a military issue and highlight how the latest science addresses this issue

Demos will restart every 30 minutes. The demos will run in 2 sessions with all demos available in either session.

Each stand will present a number of related key achievements from the program

?? Do we want to book attendees onto sessions to spread people out?? It won't be as obvious at a virtual event
Reserve one slot for a VIP group?
