# 17th September 2021

## Objective
There are two aims of this final event
* To bring the consortium together one last time and conclude what for some has been 15 years of collaboration.
* To provide an opportunity to present any work that has not already been externally presented elsewhere and is not included in the science library. 

## Agenda

This meeting will be hosted via [Webex](https://ibm.webex.com/meet/helen.bowyer). If you are asked for a meeting number please use 929 067 346.
