# US DAIS ITA Research Showcase
**This event will be hosted virtually Tuesday September 14, 2021**

At this event, research and technology transitions from the U.S. – UK Distributed Analytics & Information Science International Technology Alliance (DAIS ITA) program will be presented to leaders, stakeholders and partners to demonstrate future military warfighting concepts and capabilities, and to facilitate potential transitions to future applied research, experimentation, and demonstration programs.

The DAIS ITA brings together U.S. and UK government, industry and academic scientists and engineers to perform foundational, cross-cutting research to enable
capabilities for future coalition operations:
* Distributed, dynamic, resilient, secure networking infrastructures that adapts to dynamic missions & context with limited burden on the Soldier
* Distributed analytics among coalition partners, that rapidly learns, adapts, & reasons faster than the enemy
* Distributed reasoning & machine learning in dynamic & contested environments for assured multi-domain operations

Presentations and demonstrations will be pre-recorded and can be viewed asynchronously where linked below. Q&A and other discussion during the event will not be recorded.


Meeting guests and Non-Army 365 users may find it necessary to join the meeting via a browser (Edge or Chrome recommended). Please mute your microphone when joining the meeting. An audio only dial-in option is available:
