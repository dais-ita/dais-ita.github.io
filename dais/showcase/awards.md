- Network Motif Analysis (Cardiff, Penn State, UMASS, IBM UK)
- Semantic Vectors (ARL, IBM UK, Cardiff)

## Scientific discovery (aka scientific quality)
- Adaptive Federated Learning in Resource Constrained Edge Computing Systems (IBM US, Imperial, PSU, ARL)
- Evidential Deep Learning to Quantify Classification Uncertainty (ARL)
- A Scalable Vector Symbolic Architecture Approach for Decentralized Workflows (Cardiff, IBM UK, IBM US)
- The evolution of strongly-held group identities through agent-based cooperation (Cardiff, Yale)

## Blue sky exploration (aka scientific risk)
- Towards spike-based machine intelligence with neuromorphic computing (Purdue)
- Coalition Situational Understanding Facilitated By Vector Symbolic Architecture (Cardiff, IBM UK. UCLA, BAE)
- DeepProbCEP: A Hybrid Neuro-Symbolic Approach for Complex Event Processing in Noisy and Adversarial Settings (Cardiff, UCLA)

## Military impact
- Embedding Dynamic Knowledge Graphs based on Observational Ontologies in Semantic Vector Spaces (UK transition)
- Machine learning algorithms promise better situational awareness (read the <a href="https://www.army.mil/article/236647/machine_learning_algorithms_promise_better_situational_awareness" ARL news article</a>
- Research enhances Soldier decision making (read the <a href="https://www.army.mil/article/242195/research_enhances_soldier_decision_making" ARL news article</a>

## Commercial prosperity
