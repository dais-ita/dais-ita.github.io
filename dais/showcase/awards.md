## Cross National Collaboration
- Adaptive Federated Learning in Resource Constrained Edge Computing Systems
- Interpretability of Deep Learning Models: A Survey of Results
- Network Research Collaboration [Kin Leung Imperial, Richard Yang, Leandros Yale]

## Interdisciplinary Collaboration (straddling the goals of collaboration & advanced science, and speaks to program breadth)
- Applying AI to criminal and terrorist networks (Penn State, IBM US, IBM UK)
- Network Motif Analysis (Cardiff, Penn State, UMASS, IBM UK)
- Semantic Vectors (ARL, IBM UK, Cardiff)

## Scientific discovery (aka scientific quality)
All Joint 1st
- Adaptive Federated Learning in Resource Constrained Edge Computing Systems
- Evidential Deep Learning to Quantify Classification Uncertainty
- A Scalable Vector Symbolic Architecture Approach for Decentralized Workflows (Best paper)
- The evolution of strongly-held group identities through agent-based cooperation (Natureâ€™s open science journal, Scientific Reports, accepted for publication)

## Blue sky exploration (aka scientific risk)
- Towards spike-based machine intelligence with neuromorphic computing
- Coalition Situational Understanding Facilitated By Vector Symbolic Architecture
- DeepProbCEP: A Hybrid Neuro-Symbolic Approach for Complex Event Processing in Noisy and Adversarial Settings

## Military impact
- Embedding Dynamic Knowledge Graphs based on Observational Ontologies in Semantic Vector Spaces (UK transition)
- Machine learning algorithms promise better situational awareness (ARL news article - coreset)
- Research enhances Soldier decision making (ARL news article - ski shop)

## Commercial prosperity
- Federated Learning in IBM Cloud Pak 3.5
- FastLAS - Mark Law from Imperial has setup his own ILASP business, contracting to Dstl to advance ILASP and FastLAS for military operations
- Robust CoreSet Construction in IBM Research Early Access on Edge AI SDK

## Social Good / Community Impact
- PhD Student Cohort (50+ students across lifetime of program)
- Summer Intern Placement Program (25+ students spent summer in rotation at IBM)
- USMA Cadets (Hosted visits from 2016-2019 for 2-4visiting cadets at Hursley per year)

## Student-led Achievement (training next-generation researchers)
- Harrison Taylor/Alun Preece - Example Paper - VADR: Discriminative Multimodal Explanations for Situational Understanding
- Tiffany Tuor/Kin Leung - Example Paper - Distributed Machine Learning in Coalition Environments: Overview of Techniques
- James Ashford/Roger Whitaker - Example Paper - Understanding the Signature of Controversial Wikipedia Articles through Motifs in Editor Revision Networks (www conf)
