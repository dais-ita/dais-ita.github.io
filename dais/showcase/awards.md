## Cross National Collaboration
1. Adaptive Federated Learning in Resource Constrained Edge Computing Systems
2. Interpretability of Deep Learning Models: A Survey of Results
3. Network Research Collaboration [Kin Leung Imperial, Richard Yang, Leandros Yale]

## Interdisciplinary Collaboration (straddling the goals of collaboration & advanced science, and speaks to program breadth)
1. Applying AI to criminal and terrorist networks (Diane Felmlee, IBM US, IBM UK)
1. Network Motif Analysis (Roger Whitaker, Diane Felmlee, Don Towsley, IBM UK)
3. Semantic Vectors (Doug Summers-Stay, IBM UK, Cardiff)

## Scientific discovery (aka scientific quality)
1. Adaptive Federated Learning in Resource Constrained Edge Computing Systems
1. Evidential Deep Learning to Quantify Classification Uncertainty
1. A Scalable Vector Symbolic Architecture Approach for Decentralized Workflows (Best paper)
1. The evolution of strongly-held group identities through agent-based cooperation (Natureâ€™s open science journal, Scientific Reports, accepted for publication)

## Blue sky exploration (aka scientific risk)
1. Towards spike-based machine intelligence with neuromorphic computing
2. Coalition Situational Understanding Facilitated By Vector Symbolic Architecture
3. DeepProbCEP: A Hybrid Neuro-Symbolic Approach for Complex Event Processing in Noisy and Adversarial Settings

## Military impact
1. Embedding Dynamic Knowledge Graphs based on Observational Ontologies in Semantic Vector Spaces (UK transition)
2. Machine learning algorithms promise better situational awareness (ARL news article - coreset)
3. Research enhances Soldier decision making (ARL news article - ski shop)

## Commercial prosperity
1. Federated Learning in IBM Cloud Pak 3.5
2. FastLAS - Mark Law from Imperial has setup his own ILASP business, contracting to DSTL to advance ILASP and FastLAS for military operations
3. Robust CoreSet Construction in IBM Research Early Access on Edge AI SDK

## Social Good / Community Impact
1. PhD Student Cohort (50+ students across lifetime of program)
2. Summer Intern Placement Program (25+ students spent summer in rotation at IBM)
3. USMA Cadets (Hosted visits from 2016-2019 for 2-4visiting cadets at Hursley per year)

## Student-led Achievement (training next-generation researchers)
1. Harrison Taylor/Alun Preece - Example Paper - VADR: Discriminative Multimodal Explanations for Situational Understanding
2. Tiffany Tuor/Kin Leung - Example Paper - Distributed Machine Learning in Coalition Environments: Overview of Techniques
3. James Ashford/Roger Whitaker - Example Paper - Understanding the Signature of Controversial Wikipedia Articles through Motifs in Editor Revision Networks (www conf)
