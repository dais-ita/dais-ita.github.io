        <td>In this paper, we study the problem of how to allocate bandwidth and computation resources to deliver data analytics services at the edge. The types of services we envision consist of a chain of tasks that must be carried out sequentially, and where the number of tasks executed in the chain determines the grade in which a service is delivered. An example of such type of service is video analytics where different deep-learning algorithms are combined to provide a more accurate description of a scene. The contributions of the paper are to formulate the static resource allocation problem as a linear program, to discuss the challenges of static formulations in dynamic settings, and to propose a control-type formulation that uses approximate system dynamics and time-varying cost functions. The work also highlights the need for policies that can operate the network and learn its characteristics simultaneously.</td>
