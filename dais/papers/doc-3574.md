# Enabling smart environments through scalable policy reasoning and IoT

        <td>Abstract</td>
        <td>In this paper, we describe how to combine ontology-based policy reasoning mechanisms with in-use IoT applications to customize and automate device behaviors. We then discuss how the policy framework can be extended with data federation to handle diverse and distributed data sources. We demonstrate that smart devices and sensors can be orchestrated through policies in diverse settings, from smart home environments to hazardous workplaces, such as coal mines. Lastly, we evaluate our approach using real applications with real data and demonstrate that our approach is scalable under high load of data and devices.</td>
