        <td>Abstract</td>
        <td>Online social networks shaped by user generated content and activity offer a unique opportunity for understanding how individuals and social groups interact. Insight into the dynamics of on-line communities could prove valuable in the military context helping with: evaluation of group stability and growth, identification of key influential users, and detection of attempts to spread disinformation. To this end, we explore user behaviour on Reddit, a large social network site designed as a discussion forum for various topics. We present an initial, exploratory investigation using sentiment and activity analysis, of the behaviour and content of 944 suspicious Reddit accounts.</td>
