        <td>Abstract</td>
        <td>This paper aims to develop a conceptual framework grounded in social science theory that could, in the future, be incorporated into decision making tools. Developing a conceptual framework of group evolution requires the integration of knowledge and techniques from across multiple scientific disciplines (including psychology, psychology, the political and economic sciences and mathematics). This multi-organizational input will provide valuable insight into the framework and its future utility.</td>
