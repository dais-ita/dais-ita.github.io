        <td>Abstract</td>
        <td>Capturing and managing the data needed to build effective machine learning models for custom IoT environments requires a great deal of effort. The amount of data generated from IoT devices is abundant, but tools to find datasets appropriate for the desired models are lacking. This paper presents a data capture system and data management catalog with solutions addressing the challenges of curating IoT data applied to purpose-built machine learning deployments.</td>
