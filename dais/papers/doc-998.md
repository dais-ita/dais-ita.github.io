# Comparing Software Defined Architectures for Coalition Operations

        <td>Abstract</td>
        <td>Software Defined Networking (SDN) and analogous approaches to different domains like storage, compute and security have emerged as promising paradigms for controlling and managing many different types of distributed systems. In this paper, we examine the application of software defined concepts to coalition operations. Specifically, we propose the concept of Software Defined Coalitions (SDC), a mechanism by which IT infrastructure required by dynamic Communities of Interest (CoI) among coalitions can be enabled rapidly. We examine many different coalition interoperability architectures as SDC candidates, and evaluate their key performance metrics.</td>
