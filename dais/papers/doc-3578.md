        <td>Mobile edge computing allows wireless users to exploit the power of cloud computing without the large communication delay. To serve data-intensive applications (e.g., augmented reality, video analytics) from the edge, we need, in addition to CPU cycles and memory for computation, storage resource for storing server data and network bandwidth for receiving user-provided data. Moreover, the data placement needs to be adapted over time to serve time-varying demands, while considering system stability and operation cost. We address this problem by proposing a two-time-scale framework that jointly optimizes service (data & code) placement and request scheduling, under storage, communication, computation, and budget constraints. We fully characterize the complexity of our problem by analyzing the hardness of various cases. By casting our problem as a set function optimization, we develop a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves a constant-factor approximation under certain conditions. Extensive synthetic and trace-driven simulations show that the proposed algorithm achieves 90% of the optimal performance.</td>
