        <td>Network motifs represent local subgraphs, such as dyads, triads, and tetrads, that occur frequently in networks. The biological and physical sciences document multiple instances in which motifs appear in graphs that provide insight into the structure and processes of these networks. Yet, little work has studied motifs within social graphs. In this research, we examine the prevalence of dyad, triad, and tetrad motifs among six types of social interactions, including friendship, advice seeking, email communication, twitter messages, terrorist ties, and legislative cosponsorship. We use four networks of each type, for a total sample of 24 social networks.</td>
