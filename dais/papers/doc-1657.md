# A Prototype Systems Architecture for Coalition Situational Understanding

<table>

        <td>Abstract</td>
        <td>The implementation presented in this work forms a prototype of a conceptual architecture that addresses the key concerns within Coalition Situational Understanding (CSU). Specifically in this demo, we summaries a suitable scenario that requires a CSU approach, we showcase the architectural principles and techniques used to bring together an array of services from the various research collaborators and we present the early successes of comparing two distinct approaches used by the overall system to pass low level information from data sources upward to support higher level CSU.</td>
