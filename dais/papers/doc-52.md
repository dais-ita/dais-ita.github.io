        <td>Coalition tactical networks are composed of different networks of two or more nations coming together for securing a mission in the tactical arena. Cyber security is an important consideration in coalition operations, and is a complex challenge due to the need for operational effectiveness, as well as for limited trust relationships that exist among coalition partners. New emerging paradigms in networking, such as Software Defined Networks (SDN), provide a mechanism to deal more effectively with their security challenges. In this paper, we discuss how to utilize the principles of SDN to improve the cyber situational awareness in coalition environments as well in various military networks. We propose the concept of SDN oriented OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide and Act) loop for improving the cyber security awareness, and then demonstrate how this paradigm can be used in coalition networks.Can be on multiple lines if needed.</td>
