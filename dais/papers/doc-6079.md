        <td>The structure of social networks used for communi- cation and information exchange plays a key role in the efficient problem solving by teams and organizations. In a military coalition context, such problems are typically complex in nature, calling for an agile and dynamic approach to team formation. This demonstration illustrates the impact of various topological properties of complex networks on the speed and accuracy of collective problem solving in groups. This research supports task 10.1.2 in project 10.</td>
