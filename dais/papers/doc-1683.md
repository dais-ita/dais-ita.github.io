        <td>Firewalls represent a critical security building block for networks as they monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on the enforcement of predetermined security rules, referred to as firewall rules. Firewalls are constantly being improved to enhance network security. From being a simple filtering device, firewall has been evolved to operate in conjunction in intrusion detection and prevention systems. This paper reviews the existing firewall policies and assesses their application in highly dynamic networks such as coalitions networks. The paper also describe the need for the next-generation firewall policies and how the generative policy model can be leveraged.</td>
