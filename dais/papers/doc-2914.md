# Enabling Collaboration Across the DAIS ITA Research Program

        <td>Abstract</td>
        <td>The DAIS-ITA program is starting to increase in pace in terms of the level of experimentation being done to support the research. Demonstrations convey the work conducted and set it in a meaningful way against the context of the program. In this paper we seek to define enablements as a set of capabilities and resources to directly support collaboration, experimentation and demonstration across the DAIS ITA program. In order to reduce individual burden across projects and facilitate collaboration, some enablements are already available. This paper sets out these enablements and explores extensions to them. In addition, further enablements are possible that would extend the benefit into new areas. These are also set out and explored. Further work is expected in order to make these suggestions more concrete and to explore new areas beyond the scope of this paper.</td>
