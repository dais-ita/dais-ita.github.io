        <td>In this paper, we provide a rigorous theoretical investigation of an online learning version of the Facility Location problem which is motivated by emerging problems in real-world applications. In our formulation, we are given a set of sites and an online sequence of user requests. At each trial, the learner selects a subset of sites and then incurs a cost for each selected site and an additional cost which is the price of the userâ€™s connection to the nearest site in the selected subset. The problem may be solved by an application of the well-known Hedge algorithm. This would, however, require time and space exponential in the number of the given sites, which motivates our design of a novel quasi-linear time algorithm for this problem, with good theoretical guarantees on its performance.</td>
