        <td>Abstract</td>
        <td>In a world environment where technology is advancing at a rapid pace, fluent communication between machines and humans is becoming increasingly relevant. Interpretability through summarisation and explainability are imperative factors in the progression of machine and human communication. Using IBM Watson's visual recognition service, in conjunction with other processes we explore and establish interpretability. Specifically, we looked at identifying cancerous cells from biopsy images through visual analytics. Furthermore, future practical applications, including in different fields, were also investigated, i.e. counter IED operations.</td>
