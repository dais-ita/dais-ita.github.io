# Experimentation With Fuzzy Interest Forwarding in Named Data Networking

        <td>In the current Named Data Networking implementation, forwarding a data request requires nding an exact match between the prefix of the name carried in the request and a forwarding table entry. However, consumers may not always know the exact naming, or an exact prex, of their desired data. The current approach to this problem--establishing naming conventions and performing name lookups--can be infeasible in highly ad hoc, heterogeneous, and dynamic environments: the same data can be named using different terms or even languages, naming conventions may be minimal if they exist at all, and name lookups can be costly. In this paper, we present a fuzzy Interest forwarding approach that exploits semantic similarities between the names carried in Interest packets and the names of potentially matching data in CS and entries in FIB. We describe the fuzzy Interest forwarding approach, outline the semantic understanding function that determines the name matching, and present our simulation study along with extended evaluation results.</td>
