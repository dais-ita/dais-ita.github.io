        <td>This demonstration showcases some of the research being carried out as part of Project 6 Task 2, “Understanding group behavior through motifs”, in the BPP 2018 research program. The demonstration will be linked to the DAIS ITA scenario, specifically Phase 3 and Vignette 1 and will draw together collaborative research and results from across this task. Network motifs refer to recurring, significant patterns of interaction between sets of nodes. While an external network of interest may not be fully visible to the coalition, motifs represent important atomic substructures more likely to be visible, from which inferences can be made. This demonstration shows the progress that we have made against two of the three subtasks in this research (the third subtask has not yet been addressed in the research so cannot be demonstrated, however the demonstration infrastructure will continue to be developed throughout the research program, with the third subtask being integrated as soon as results are available).</td>
