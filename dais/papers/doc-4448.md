# Generating Client Side Policies for Cyber-Physical Safety

        <td>Abstract</td>
        <td>Cyber physical systems are increasingly connected to the Internet for reasons of convenience and efficiency. However, such cyber-physical systems are exposed to new vulnerabilities since they may be compromised by an attack from the Internet. In addition to traditional network security mechanisms, such systems need additional mechanism which can prevent the exploitation of their physical vulnerabilities. We propose an architecture in which the behavior of the system can be controlled by having it generate the policies for its own protection automatically.</td>
