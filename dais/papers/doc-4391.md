# A Demonstration of Generative Policy Models in Coalition Environments

        <td>Abstract</td>
        <td>Autonomous systems are expected to have a major impact in future coalition operations to assist humans in achieving complex tasks. Policies are typically used by systems to define their behavior and constraints and often these policies are manually configured and managed by humans. This paper presents a demonstration of a recent Generative Policy-based Model (GPM) approach applied to generating coalition policies for asset serviceability. This demonstrates the flexibility of the approach for generating policies in a distributed coalition environment to facilitate effective collaboration between coalition partners.</td>
