# SFP: Toward Interdomain Coalition Programming

        <td>Abstract</td>
        <td>One fundamental challenge for software-defined coalition (SDC) is how to program networks from different coalition partners to achieve a single coalition goal. Although there is substantial prior work, including both SDN, for logically centralized software-defined networks, and BGP, for policy-based interdomain routing connecting multiple autonomous networks, the prior work has substantial limitations in achieving desired scalability, efficiency and stability. In this paper, we introduce software-defined federation programming (SFP), an abstraction and programming framework that (1) extends the current SDN abstraction, so that each coalition member network exposes a programming abstraction for interdomain control, which we call eSDN, beyond current single-domain programming abstraction, which we call iSDN; (2) introduces the SFP protocol, so that the information exchange among coalition members using either iSDN or eSDN, is fine-grained, efficient and scalable, and (3) introduces a learning based interdomain orchestration layer, so that SDC mission programmers do not need to handle complex interdomain policy interactions among coalition partners.
