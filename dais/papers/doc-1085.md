# Policy Conflict Resolution in IoT via Planning

<table>

        <td>Abstract</td>
        <td>With the explosion of connected devices to automate tasks, manually governing interactions among such devices — and associated services — has become an impossible task. This is because devices have their own obligations and prohibitions in context, and humans are not equipped to maintain a bird's-eyeview of the environment. Motivated by this observation, in this paper, we present an ontology based policy framework which can efficiently detect policy conflicts and automatically resolve such using an AI planner.</td>
