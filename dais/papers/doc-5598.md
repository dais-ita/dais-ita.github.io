# Demo Abstract: Acoustic Anomaly Detection System

        <td>Abstract</td>
        <td>Acoustic signals contain rich information of the environment. They can be used for detecting anomalous events such as in automated machine monitoring. In this demonstration, we present our acoustic anomaly detection system that captures acoustic signals and classifies them using machine learning techniques. Our system includes a server for sound management and model training, a mobile client for sound capturing and real-time classification, and a workbench that acts as a user interface. We will show the full operational pipeline of our system in this demonstration.</td>
