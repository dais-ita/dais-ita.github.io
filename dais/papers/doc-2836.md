# CISpaces.org: from Fact Extraction to Report generation

<table>

        <td>Abstract</td>
        <td>We introduce CISpaces.org, a tool to support situational understanding in intelligence analysis that complements but not replaces human expertise. The system combines natural language processing, argumentation-based reasoning, and natural language generation to produce intelligence reports from social media data, and to record the process of forming hypotheses from relationships among information. In this paper, we show how CISpaces.org meets the desirable requirements elicited from senior professionals, and demonstrate its usage and capabilities to support analysts in delivering effective and tailored intelligence to decision makers.</td>
