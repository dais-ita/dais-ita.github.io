# Invocation Oriented Architecture for Agile Code and Agile Data

        <td>Abstract</td>
        <td>In order to address the unique requirements of sensor information fusion in a tactical coalition environment, we are proposing a new architecture -- one based on the concept of invocations. An invocation is a combination of a software code and a piece of data, both managed using techniques from Information Centric networking. This paper will discuss limitations of current approaches, present the architecture for an invocation oriented architecture, illustrate how it works with an example scenario, and provide reasons for its suitability in a coalition environment.</td>
