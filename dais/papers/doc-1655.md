# Decentralized Workflows Using Vector Symbolic Architectures

        <td>Abstract</td>
        <td>Decentralized workflows require a means of specifying distributed data and computing control dependencies amongst services without the centralized coordination of the flow. Applying the state-of-the-art in workflow research—especially in dynamic coalition network environments—raises several technical challenges, for example: * Obtaining a stable endpoint to deploy the service manager is impractical—if not impossible—due to the variable network * Connectivity associated with mobile endpoints (e.g.,unmanned autonomous systems); * High latency and cost associated with communication (e.g.,satellite);and * Poor infrastructure, especially absent back-end connectivity. Consequently, in dynamic environments, a new class of workflow methodology is required—i.e., a workflow which operates in a decentralized manner. In this demonstration we show how such a decentralised workflow can be realized by making use of structured associative memory models called Vector Symbolic Architectures, from the artificial intelligence community.</td>
