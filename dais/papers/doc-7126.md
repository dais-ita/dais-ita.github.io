        <td>Abstract</td>
        <td>Rich sensor-enabled wearable devices have permeated our daily lives. A rich modality of sensing is location and time, which provide deep insights into the patterns of life at individual and societal scale. Coupled with the rise of on-demand compute in the form of cloud, mining and extracting insights from such “spatiotemporal” data for healthcare and other applications is gaining prominence. This chapter focuses on the challenges of mining and deriving actionable insights from societal scale trajectory data with applications of artificial intelligence to real-world problems.</td>
