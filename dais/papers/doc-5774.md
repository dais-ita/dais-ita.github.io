# Self-Generation of Access Control Policies

        <td>Abstract</td>
        <td>Access control for information has primarily focused on access statically granted to subjects by administrators usually in the con- text of a specific system. Even if mechanisms are available for access revocation, revocations must still be executed manually by an administrator. However, as physical devices become increasingly embedded and interconnected, access control needs to become an integral part of the resources being protected and be generated dynamically by the resources depending on the context in which they are being used. In this paper, we discuss a set of scenarios for access control needed in current and future systems and use that to argue that an approach for resources to generate and manage their access control policies dynamically on their own is needed. We discuss some approaches for generating such access control policies that may address the requirements of the scenarios.</td>
