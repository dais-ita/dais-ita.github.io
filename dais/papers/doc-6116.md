# Analysing Reddit interactions through reply networks

        <td>Abstract</td>
        <td>Reply networks capture meaningful interactions in online discussion threads which help characterise the individual and collective group behaviour in conversations, including signals relating to both negative and positive ties. We model discussion threads as a directed network of users where an edge represents a reply from one user to another. This demo presents a real- time interactive data visualisation of techniques we use to model these networks using the Reddit online social media platform. We demonstrate the representation and analysis of Reddit reply networks including the key dimensions of age and “karma” (a platform specific popularity score on posts). The demonstration provides insight into the utility that can derived from this representation, including novel visualisation.</td>
