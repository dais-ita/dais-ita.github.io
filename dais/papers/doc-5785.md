        <td>In this paper we propose a computational method- ology for assessing the impact of trust associated to sources of information in scientific enquiry activities building upon recent proposals of an ontology for situational understanding and results in computational argumentation. Often trust in the source of information serves as a proxy for evaluating the quality of the information itself, especially in the cases of information overhead. We show how our computational methodology, composed of an ontology for representing uncertain information and sources, as well as an argumentative process of conjecture and refutation, support human analysts in scientific enquiry, as well as high- lighting issues that demand further investigation.</td>
