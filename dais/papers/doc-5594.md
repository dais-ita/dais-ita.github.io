        <td>A method includes training, using a first set of training data, to produce a machine learning model to generate an output based on an input. In an embodiment, the method includes training, using a second set of training data, to produce a second model to generate the output based on the input. In an embodiment, the method includes receiving a query to explain a decision-making process of the machine learning model. In an embodiment, the method includes producing, in response to the query, an explanation of the decision-making process of the second model.</td>
