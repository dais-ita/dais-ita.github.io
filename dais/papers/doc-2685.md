# Learning and Reasoning in Complex Coalition Information Environments: a Critical Analysis

        <td>Abstract</td>
        <td>In this paper we provide a critical analysis with metrics that will inform guidelines for designing distributed systems for Collective Situational Understanding (CSU). CSU requires both collective insight—i.e., accurate and deep understanding of a situation derived from uncertain and often sparse data and collective foresight—i.e., the ability to predict what will happen in the future. When it comes to complex scenarios, the need for a distributed CSU naturally emerges, as a single monolithic approach not only is unfeasible: it is also undesirable. We therefore propose a principled, critical analysis of AI techniques that can support specific tasks for CSU to derive guidelines for designing distributed systems for CSU.</td>
