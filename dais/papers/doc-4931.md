        <td>Abstract</td>
        <td>Manually analyzing vast amounts of newly released malware is a significant problem for the security community. Deep-learning techniques have recently been employed to automate security tasks such as malware analysis, intrusion detection, and botnet detection. We look at such techniques and investigate how practical and secure they are.</td>
