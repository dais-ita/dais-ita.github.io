        <td>Abstract</td>
        <td>Cognitive Computing (CC) has emerged in recent years as a term for computational systems that, in general, draw on the domains of artificial intelligence and signal processing [1]. A cognitive system is characterised by capabilities including: * HCC human-computer collaboration * KRR knowledge representation and reasoning MAS multi-agent systems * ML machine learning * NLP natural language processing VSP vision and speech processing In this paper, we characterise the Coalition Situational Understanding (CSU) problem, and argue that this problem fundamentally requires a CC solution.</td>
