        <td>While humans can act as effective sensors, human input is subject to a high degree of error and highly dependent on the context. Furthermore, extracting the signal from the noise for social sensing is a dicult challenge. One approach to improving the accuracy of social sensing is to use physical sensors as a control knob for social sensing algorithms. In this paper, we present an architecture for using audio sensors as a way to control an algorithm used for social sensing of interesting events. We present various use cases where the architecture is applicable, and go into the details of one specific use case, namely using crowd behavior in a golf-course to identify and control social media feeds related to the course.</td>
