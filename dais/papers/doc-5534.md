# Strategyproof Reinforcement Learning for Online Resource Allocation

        <td>We consider an online resource allocation problem where tasks with specific values, sizes and resource requirements arrive dynamically over time, and have to be either serviced or rejected immediately. Reinforcement learning is a promising approach for this, but existing work on reinforcement learning has neglected that task owners may misreport their task requirements or values strategically when this is to their benefit. To address this, we apply mechanism design and propose a novel mechanism based on reinforcement learning that aims to maximise social welfare, is strategyproof and individually rational (i.e., truthful reporting and participation are incentivised). In experiments, we show that our algorithm achieves results that are typically within 90% of the optimal social welfare, while outperforming approaches that use fixed pricing (by up to 86% in specific cases).</td>
