        <td>Abstract</td>
        <td>We demonstrate CISpaces.org, a tool to support situational understanding in intelligence analysis that complements but not replaces human expertise, for the first time applied to a judicial context. The system combines argumentationbased reasoning and natural language generation to support the creation of analysis and summary reports, and to record the process of forming hypotheses from relationships among information.</td>
