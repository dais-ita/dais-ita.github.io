        <td>Graphlets, small induced subgraphs, provide insight into structural properties of complex networks and can be used to characterize and compare the topological similarity across networks of different genre. However, existing methodologies do not consider the degree in which the induced subgraphs overlap with one another by sharing edges and nodes. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which the incorporation of higher- order network properties relating to the overlap of subgraphs can provide additional utility for network analysis tasks. The preliminary results presented here motivate further work towards a general-purpose method for examining how the mesoscale features of networks are interconnected.</td>
