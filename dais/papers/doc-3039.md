        <td>Abstract</td>
        <td>This paper argues the need for research to realize uncertainty aware artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI&ML) systems for decision support by describing a number of motivating scenarios. Furthermore, the paper defines uncertainty awareness and lays out the challenges along with surveying some promising research directions. A theoretical demonstration illustrates how two emerging uncertainty-aware ML and AI technologies could be integrated and be of value for a route planning operation.</td>
