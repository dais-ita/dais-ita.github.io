        <td>Psychological theories of inter-group behaviour offer justified representations for interaction, influence, and motivation for coalescence. Agent-based modelling of this behaviour, using evolutionary approaches, further provides a powerful tool to examine the implications of these theories in a dynamic context. In particular, this can enhance our understanding of the escalation of hostility and warfare, and its mitigation, contributing to policy and interventions. In this paper we propose a framework through which social psychology can be embedded in computation for the examination of inter-group behaviour. We examine how various social-psychological theories can be embedded in evolutionary models, and identify ways in which visualisation can support the objective assessment of emergent behaviour. We also discuss how real-world data can be used to parameterise scenarios on which modelling is conducted.</td>
