        <td>Abstract</td>
        <td>Current understanding of human behaviour and prejudice highlights the role of categorisation through stereotyping. In this demonstration we show a computer simulation that shows the evolution of prejudice between groups under a range of conditions focusing on parameters such as the extent of mixing and learning. This research supports task 4.1 in project 4.</td>
