# Edge Computing Architecture for applying AI to IoT

<table>

    <tr>
        <td>Abstract</td>
        <td>The proliferation of connected IoT devices creates a big data problem for AI based approaches. The response time required by such devices necessitates IoT data to be processed at the edge, but the edge typically lacks the resources to learn the AI models. We present an architecture which preserves the advantages of both edge processing and server-based/cloud-centric computing for AI algorithms. We discuss how policy management can be used to improve and support this architecture.</td>
