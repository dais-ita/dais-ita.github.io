# Generative Policy Architecture for Access Control Use Case

<table>

    <tr>
        <td>Abstract</td>
        <td>Policy-based management has been used to simplify the management and operations of complex environments in various domains. However, the current model for policy-based management has the semantics that the machine view of policies is determined by the refinement process, and the managed system has no ability to define its own policies. We proposed a new approach, called Generative Policy Model, which allows a flexibility and freedom of actions for the managed systems to determine their own behavior. In this demonstration, we present a coalition environment where the managed systems have the ability to generate their own policies by using the generative policy architecture for the access control scenario in a surveillance coalition mission.</td>
