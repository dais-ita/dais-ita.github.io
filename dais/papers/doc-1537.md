# Unicorn: Unified Resource Orchestration for Software Defined Coalitions

        <td>Abstract</td>
        <td>Software defined coalitions (SDC), where different partners contribute various resources, e.g., sensing, computation, storage and networking resources, to collaboratively collect, share and analyze extremely large amounts of data, calls for a framework to manage a large set of distributively-owned, heterogeneous resources, with the fundamental objective of ef- ficient resource utilization, following the autonomy and privacy of coalition domains. In this work, we design Unicorn, the first unified framework that accomplishes this goal. The foundation of Unicorn includes RSDP, a cross-domain resource discovery and integration system using a novel query algorithm to provide ac- curate, minimal resource availability information across different coalition domains, and Miro, an orchestrator performing global resource allocation for coalition workflows. In addition, Unicorn also provides a coalition workflow demand automation system to manage the resource demand dynamics of coalition workflows.</td>
