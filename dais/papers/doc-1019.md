        <td>In order to get the modularity and reconfigurability for sensor information fusion services in modern battle-spaces, dynamic service composition and dynamic topology determination is needed. In the current state-of-the-art, such information fusion services are composed manually and in a programmatic manner. In this paper, we consider an approach towards more automation by assuming that the topology of a solution is provided, and automatically choosing the different types and kinds of algorithms which can be used at each step. This includes the use of contextual information and techniques such as multi-arm bandits for investing the exploration and exploitation tradeoff.</td>
