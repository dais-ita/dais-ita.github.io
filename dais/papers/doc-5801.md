        <td>Since the early development of Software-Defined Network (SDN) technology, researchers have been concerned with the idea of physical distribution of the control plane to ad- dress scalability and reliability challenges of centralized designs. However, having multiple controllers managing the network while maintaining a “logically-centralized” network view brings additional challenges. One such challenge is how to coordinate the management decisions made by the controllers which is usually achieved by disseminating synchronization messages in a peer-to-peer manner. While there exist many architectures and protocols to ensure synchronized network views and drive coordination among controllers, there is no systematic method- ology for deciding the optimal frequency (or rate) of message dissemination. In this paper, we fill this gap by introducing the SDN synchronization problem: how often to synchronize the network views for each controller pair. Our objective is to maximize the performance of applications of interest which may be affected by the synchronization rate. Using techniques from learning theory, we derive algorithms with provable performance guarantees. Evaluation results demonstrate significant benefits over baseline schemes that synchronize all controller pairs at equal rate.</td>
