# Towards an Architecture for Policy Based Management of Software Defined Coalitions

        <td>Abstract</td>
        <td>Future infrastructure systems will require increased flexibility and agility in order to respond to changing mission goals, external threats and complex environments. Two key enablers for such agility are Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Policy Based Management (PBM). This paper discusses the needs of SDN and PBM and suggests a common architecture that allows these two techniques to coexist and work synergistically. In particular the case of Software Defined Coalitions (SDC) is considered, where infrastructure resources (networking, storage and processing) are contributed from multiple partners to achieve a common goal.</td>
