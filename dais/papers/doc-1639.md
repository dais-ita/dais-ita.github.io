# Improving Security in Coalition Tactical Environments using an SDN approach

        <td>Abstract</td>
        <td>Coalition tactical environments are composed of different networks of two or more organizations coming together to perform a short-term tactical operation with a well-defined mission. Cyber security is an important consideration in coalition operations, and is a complex challenge due to the need for operational effectiveness, and limited trust relationships that exist among coalition partners. New emerging paradigms in networking, such as Software Defined Networks (SDN), provide a mechanism to deal more effectively with their security challenges. In this chapter, we provide an overview of tactical coalition environments, and discuss how to utilize the principles of SDN to improve security and cyber situational awareness in coalition environments. As part of this discussion, we also discuss how SDN approaches can help in improving the security and operations of non-coalition tactical networks.</td>
