# Embedding dynamic knowledge graphs based on observational ontologies in semantic vector spaces

        <td>Knowledge graphs (KGs) provide a useful representation format for capturing complex knowledge about an information domain, with rich logical descriptions available for defining the relationships between entities. Separately, semantic vector spaces (SVSs) capture the relative meanings of terms based on their actual usage within a dataset and allow useful operations for exploring the relationships between these terms. Combining KGs and SVSs via knowledge graph embedding (KGE) enables further analysis tasks to leverage learned semantic vectors to gain additional insights. Therefore, KGE represents an interesting and potentially powerful tool for identifying emergent or unexpected behavior, or for seeking previously unaccounted for relationships, event, and groups. In this work, we report on the state-of-the-art in KGE. We describe the operational benefits that can be gained from this approach and the considerations that apply for observational ontologies that describe a complex, untrusted, time-sensitive, and rapidly-evolving environment. We suggest several promising avenues for future research in this context.</td>
