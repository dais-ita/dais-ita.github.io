# Addressing the Limitations of AI/ML in creating Cognitive Solutions

<table>

        <td>Abstract</td>
        <td>In order to solve real-world problems associated with development of Cognitive Solutions, several key problems need to be addressed. The current state of art in AI/ML is too limited for it to offer practical solutions that will outperform manually developed solutions in a large number of contexts. Building upon experience developed in creating AI/ML solutions for enterprise networks and IoT focused solutions, we will outline the limitations of current AI/ML systems, and discuss ways to address those challenges. We would also describe the vision of an AI/ML based system that ought to be developed in order to attain the vision of a true cognitive AI/ML systems that can be used in a broad set of enterprise contexts.</td>
