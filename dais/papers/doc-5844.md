# Application of Generative Policy to Software Defined Slices

        <td>Abstract</td>
        <td>Software Defined Coalitions (SDC) involve the coordination of a set of assets to deliver a user task across a coalition, with the aim of utilising distributed resources from across multiple partners. To maximise the effectiveness of an SDC in a complex military environment there is a requirement to have a coherent control and management policy framework, with reduced manpower but still able to rapidly respond to changes in context and dynamically meet end user objectives. In this complex coalition setting, generative policy has been proposed as a solution for allowing systems to make agile autonomous decisions and allow for the greatest interoperability. We analyse the management of policy across the coalition and subsequently identify policies across the entire SDC lifecycle. In order to do this we present a case study demonstrating coalition operations in a challenging, congested environment with dynamic changing circumstances to illustrate the advantages of using generative policies across a diversity of resources. We discuss the characteristics of the different types of policy and show where generative policy is most effective in an operational SDC.</td>
