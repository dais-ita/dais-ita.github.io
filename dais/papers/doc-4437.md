# Nash Bargaining Solution to Multi-Objective Resource Allocation and Sharing in SDC

        <td>Abstract</td>
        <td>Resource allocation and sharing among domains is a basic problem in the SDC for coalition partners. We propose a multi-objective framework for resource sharing and allocation among the SDC domains. To address the resource scarcity problem, we exploit resource sharing among different domains where each domain may have a particular objective (utility) to optimize. This results in a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem for which we present an N-person Nash Bargaining Solution (NBS) to guarantee the Pareto optimality. To reduce the complexity of the N-person NBS, we transform it into an equivalent optimization problem that can be readily solved. We further prove that the strong duality property holds for the formulated problem, which thus enables us to develop a distributed algorithm for obtaining the NBS. Our experimental results confirm that besides improving the ability to satisfy the application demands for resources, the proposed NBS framework for resource allocation and sharing also improves the utility of different domains in the SDC.</td>
