# LRU Cache under Stationary Requests

        <td>Abstract</td>
        <td>In this paper we extend an approximation first proposed by Fagin [4] for the LRU cache under the independence reference model to systems where requests for different contents form independent stationary and ergodic processes. We show that this approximation becomes exact as the number of contents goes to infinity while maintaining the fraction of the contents that can populate the cache to be constant. Last, we provide results on the rate of convergence.</td>
