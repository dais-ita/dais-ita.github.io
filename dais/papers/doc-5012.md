        <td>Abstract</td>
        <td>Securing the Internet of Things (IoT) is not straightforward because of device heterogeneity, highly dynamic and unprotected environments, and large scale. In this paper, we first outline IoT security risks and a security lifecycle for IoT systems. We then discuss various tools and methods that can be used for the different phases of such a lifecycle. For each such phase, we also discuss research directions. We conclude the paper by outlining a few challenges.</td>
