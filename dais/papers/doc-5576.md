        <td>Abstract</td>
        <td>Embodiments of the invention are directed to a computer implemented method of distributed learning using a fusion-based approach. The method includes determining data statistics at each system node of a plurality of system nodes, wherein each system node respectively comprises an artificial intelligence model. The method further includes determining a set of control and coordination instructions for training each artificial intelligence model at each system node of the plurality of system nodes. The method further includes directing an exchange of data between the plurality of system nodes based on the data statistics of each system node of the plurality of system nodes. The method further includes fusing trained artificial intelligence models from the plurality of system nodes into a fused artificial intelligence model, wherein the trained artificial intelligence models are trained using the set of control and coordination instructions.</td>
