        <td>Several recent studies have examined the factors that lead to the emergence of terrorism and why some locations are more frequently targeted than others. However, much of the current research has an implicit assumption that the different observations involving terrorist incidents and terrorist groups are independent of each other. In this paper, we show that the assumption is not always valid. Using two mode network analytics approach to study terrorist incidents in India between 1990 and 2015, we find that terrorist groups and their target locations have a tendency to occur in clusters. Data for the study was obtained from the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), and the South Asian Terrorism Portal (SATP). An analysis of two-mode centrality and the cluster attributes can help in identifying and understanding the factors underlying terrorist incidents.</td>
