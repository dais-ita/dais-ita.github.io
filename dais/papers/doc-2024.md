# Research Challenges in Dynamic Policy-Based Autonomous Security

        <td>Abstract</td>
        <td>Generative policies enable devices to generate their own policies that are validated, consistent and conflict free. This autonomy is required for security policy generation to deal with the large number of smart devices per person that will soon become reality. In this paper, we discuss the research issues that have to be addressed in order for devices involved in security enforcement to automatically generate their security policies -- enabling policy-based autonomous security management. We discuss the challenges involved in the task of automatic security policy generation, and outline some approaches based from machine learning that may potentially provide a solution to the same.</td>
