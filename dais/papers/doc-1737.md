        <td>Abstract</td>
        <td>We study and quantify the performance enhance- ment achievable under the distributed software-defined net- working (SDN) architecture, which is the composition of inter- connected SDN-based network domains. Under a generic network model, we develop mathematical frameworks to analyze the performance metric of distributed SDN under various inter-domain synchronization levels and network properties. Simulations based on both synthetic and real network topologies confirm the accuracy of our theoretical results. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work quantifying the performance of distributed SDN analytically, which provides fundamental guidance for future SDN protocol designs and performance estimation.</td>
