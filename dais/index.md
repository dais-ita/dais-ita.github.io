Welcome to the legacy site for the DAIS ITA research program.  This was an inter-disciplinary US/UK
collaboration across government, academia  and industry from 2016 to 2021.

# Clusters
The legacy of the DAIS ITA comes in two main forms: [A list of publications](/science-library/) that have arisen from the
program, and a set of final showcase demonstrations and presentations that have been designed around a
closely linked set of three clusters:

* Cluster 1: [Learning in Complex Coalition Environments](/cluster1/)
* Cluster 2: [Resilient Coalition Networking](/cluster2/)
* Cluster 3: [Integrating ad hoc Coalition teams and understanding dynamic audiences](/cluster3/)
