For each of these three distinct research phases a final report summarising the research and
the publications was produced:

* [IPP summary report (2016 - 2018)](/dais/historical_docs/files/IPP-Program-Summary.pdf)
  plus [IPP publication summary](/dais/historical_docs/files/IPP-Publication-Summary.pdf)
