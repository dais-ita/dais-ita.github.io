## Cogni-sketch
Cogni-sketch is an experimental environment to explore human-agent teaming in rapidly formed situations, where the
agents must come together to solve problems and achieve situational understanding.  It embodies the concept of
Human-Agent Knowledge Fusion (HAKF) through tellability (knowledge creation) and explainability (for rapid trust calibration or knowledge sharing).

## Achievements
Cogni-sketch features in the following achievements:
* [Enabling rapidly formed human-agent coalition teams through extensible information exchange](/1c01/)
* [Adapting AI systems to recognise new patterns of distributed activity](/1c16/)
* [AI based Analysis of Terrorism Events](/3a13/)
