## Evidential Logic Programming (ELP)
Evidential Logic Programming aims at providing uncertainty-aware learning and reasonig capabilities to logical programming languages, such as Prolog, so to encompass both epistemic and aleatory uncertainty.

For further details, please see the following tutorials:
