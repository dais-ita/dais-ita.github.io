## Evidential Learning and Reasoning (ELR)
Evidential Learning and Reasoning aims at providing uncertainty-aware learning and 
reasoning capabilities to AI systems, so to encompass both epistemic and aleatory uncertainty.

For further details, please see the following tutorials:
* [ELP-tutorial](https://youtu.be/D1t1GFZsD8Y)

## Achievements
ELR features in 
* [Enabling rapidly formed human-agent coalition teams through extensible information exchange](/1c01/);
* [Uncertainty-Aware AI&ML](/1d05/).

It comprises research both in Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) and Evidential Logic Programming (ELP).
