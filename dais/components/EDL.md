## Evidential Deep Learning (EDL)
Evidential Deep Learning aims at providing uncertainty-aware learning capabilities to Deep Neural Networks architecture, so to encompass both epistemic and aleatory uncertainty.

## Achievements
ELP features in [Enabling rapidly formed human-agent coalition teams through extensible information exchange](/1c01/).

## Publications
