# Integrating ad hoc Coalition teams and understanding dynamic audiences

Coalition operations occur in a complex and highly dynamic socio-technical information environment. Thus, there is a need to:

#	Achieve rapid cognitive co-ordination amongst ad hoc Combined, Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmental and Multinational (CJIIM) Coalitions and CJIIM teams.
* [Efficient collective problem solving:](/3b02/) Designing effective problem solving teams using agent-based modelling.  

#	Understand the interplay between groups and individuals and thus the potential of interventions to influence behaviour.  
*	[Modelling the Emergent Behaviour of Human Social Groups.](/3c01/)  Agent-based modelling of way in which group and individual psychological behaviours interact, give rise to effects such as prejudice and devotion to a cause, and the emergence of opposed groups. 
*	[Effect of organizational structure on cultural cohesion.](/3b03/) Modelling spread of cultural features within an organisation.                                    
*	[Winning hearts and minds: maximising influence in social networks.](/3b01/) Mathematics of optimal solutions under different conditions. 
*	[Understanding dynamic patterns of terrorist networks through graph analytic methods.](/3a10/)  Changes in network behaviour in build-up to an attack. 

#	Rapidly assess dynamically evolving behaviour of audiences in response to unfolding events, competing narratives and disinformation.
*	[Understanding social networks from the local behaviours within the network.](/3a03/)  Enabling analysis when only have visibility of part of network and without processing language. 
*	[Identifying the network signature of negative behaviours in social networks.](/3a05/) Detecting the inception of negative behaviours and their network effects. 
*	[Predicting Spread of Negative Attitudes and Behaviours in Social Networks.](/3a06/)  Graph-based methods offer improved prediction over traditional statistical approaches. 
* [Enhancing Situation Understanding through Negative-ties enhanced AI pipelines.](/3a13/)  Improving AI analysis with user-knowledge.
