# Clusters

The work of the DAIS ITA has been summarised into three clusters, each of which contains a number of key outcomes
which describe the broad impact of a theme of the research along with links to relevant papers and other material.

These three clusters are:

* [Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Contested Multi-Domain Coalition Operations](/AI_Cluster/)
* [Integrating Ad hoc Coalition Teams and Understanding Dynamic Audiences](/Integrating_Cluster/)
* [Resilient Coalition Networks](/Resilient_Cluster/)
