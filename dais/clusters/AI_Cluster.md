# AI in Contested Multi-Doman Coalition Operations

Military operations typically involve working with partners to resolve rapidly evolving situations where adversaries are adapting their tactics, techniques and procedures, and the behaviour of the civilian population is changing. Thus, there is a need for:

## Adaptable AI
AI which can rapidly adapt in dynamic situations and learn as the operation proceeds exploiting synergies between humans and machine intelligence (inc. novel Neuro-Symbolic Learning (NSL) AI systems which combine reasoning and deep learning);

*	[Adapting AI Systems to Recognise New Patterns of Distributed Activity.](/1c16/) 
Improved human-AI teaming, AI learning (inc. NSL) and DAIS technology integration: running in real-time at edge.
*	[Neural-Symbolic Generative Policy Model for Coalition Operations.](/1c02/)
Adapting to changes between data used for training an AI and reality.
*	[Adaptive AI Systems for Human-Machine Federated Decision Making.](/1c05/)
*	[FastLAS: Rule Learning for Policy Generation and Situational Awareness.](/1c08/)  
Logic-based AI that learns rules from examples.
*	[Reinforcement Learning (RL) for Network Control.](/1c15/)  
New techniques for real-time complex control problems.
*	[Characterising New Devices on a Network with Zero-Shot Learning.](/1c04/) 
Characterising previously unseen devices by inspection of their traffic.
*	[Cogni-Sketch: Enabling Rapidly Formed Human-Agent Coalition Teams through Extensible Information Exchange.](/1c01/) 
Software platform enabling human-agent interaction.

## Trusted AI
Enable human users to rapidly achieve an appropriate degree of trust in AI systems when making high-stakes decisions;
*	[Achieving Rapid Trust of Adaptable Artificial Intelligence Systems.](/1d04/) High level design and matching to user roles. 
*	[Uncertainty-Aware Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for Robust Human on the Loop Decision Making.](/1d05/) Revealing when the AI does not know in real-time at the edge.

*	[Testing the Reliability and Consistency of Explanation Metrics.](/1e04/) New tests expose problems with saliency metrics.


## Resilient AI
AI which is resilient to adversary attacks which seek to deceive the AI systems;
*	[Model Poisoning Attacks and Defences in Federated Learning](/1e05/) (aka Distributed Coalition AI). Defending against partner attacks.
*	[Adversary Exploitation of Explainable AI and Defence Approach.](/1e03/)  Defending against adversary use of AI explanations to develop attacks.
*	[Gradient Free Attacks on Multiple Modalities.](/1e01/)  Reducing the amount of data required, about a model, to launch a successful deception attack.

## Distributed Coalition AI.  
AI systems able to share data and models with partners whilst operating under a range of privacy constraints and in degraded communications environments;
*	[Federated Learning in Resource Constrained Edge Computing Systems.](/1b06/) Sharing learning, not data, and synchronising models with a minimal number of messages.  ??1a08

*	[One Shot Federation for Coalition Model Sharing.](/1b01/)  Incremental and intermittent shared learning using a representation of the data distribution (not the data itself). 
*	[Coreset-based Machine Learning.](/1b04/)  Multi-dimension data summarisation (reducing comms usage) which also enables machine learning.

## Integrated Distributed Analytics.  
Able to integrate analytic services in (near) real-time with partners in degraded communication environments;
*	[Vector Symbolic Architectures and Hyperdimensional Computing for Coalition Operations - An Overview.](/1a01/)  Dynamic decentralised discovery of assets (e.g. information services & data) and chaining them together (i.e. workflow construction and orchestration) to perform a task.
